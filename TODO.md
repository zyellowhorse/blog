# TOOD

- Add highight to text when selecting the link from the table of contents
- Maybe look into using a libaray to create the table of contents instead of doing it manually
- Add tags to my posts
- Look into creating a search function to look up posts / tags
- Add a copy to clipboard button to code blocks
- Add toggle to switch between light and dark theme
- maybe look into changing fonts because "fi" next to each other overlap and looks weird
- Maybe update the inline code background color to stand out more 
- Figure out how to get syntax highlighting working in code blocks
- Maybe there is a way to have hyperlinks open in a new tab
- Fix metadata image for when linking site externally. Card generation.
- Stop using the template 404 page and create a custom one
